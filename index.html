        The force of a spring can be expressed as<br>
        <br>
        F = k(n-x)<br>
        <br>
        where<br>
        k = spring constant<br>
        n = natural length of the spring<br>
        x = length of the spring<br>
        Dividing this with m, the mass of the weight, will reveal the acceleration of the weight at certain point<br>
        <br>
        Acc = k/m(n-x)<br>
        <br>
        Here, x can be re-written as a function of t, and Acc as a double derivative of x in terms of t<br>
        <br>
        x''(t) = k/m(n-x(t))<br>
        k/m*x(t) = k/m*n-x''(t)<br>
        x(t) = n-m/k*x''(t)<br>
        <br>
        solving this will give the following<br>
        <br>
        x(t) = n-a*sin(√(k/m)*t)<br>
        <br>
        Where a is the amplitude of the oscillation.<br>
        Since we're starting this simulation with spring at its fully extended position, we can shift the phase<br>
        <br>
        x(t) = n-a*sin(√(k/m)*t+π/2)<br>
        x(t) = n-a*cos(√(k/m)*t)<br>
        <br>
        when x(t) = n<br>
        x(t) = n-a*cos(π/2+π*N)<br>
        <br>
        Therefore we can exploit this formula to get π resulting in<br>
        <br>
        π=t√(k/m)/(1/2+N)<br>
